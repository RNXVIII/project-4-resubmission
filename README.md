## double booking

just like in the old project , the resubmission was able to cover this again and stop users from double booking 

## Authenticaton 

when starting the app you need an account to see whats what a small but helpful feature

## Features left to impliment

annoyingly there was some things i couldnt get done in time / didnt understand

- fix my tests (test was planned and impliemented but didnt get fixed)

- figure out whats wrong with all auth packages, then:

import allauth templates , include base.html and add css styling

# Diagrams, Flowcharts and ERDS

not much planning was done as i had to keep switching and overcoming problems so i had to use what i learned
and created the project 

however there is an ERD for the bookings model which is here:

# Important

## why is the project like this?

overall this resubmission was trying to cover as much criteria as possible using what ive done from my previous project and plannning around that , it has much more into it than before but honestly lacks slighly less than whats needed and what i wanted.

overall i hope my documentation isnt too hard to read. 

it was exasperating but im still learning/relearning  an awful lot from this project

thank you for viewing this project.
