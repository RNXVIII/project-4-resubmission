## double booking

just like in the old project , the resubmission was able to cover this again and stop users from double booking 

## Authenticaton 

when starting the app you need an account to see whats what a small but helpful feature

## Features left to impliment

annoyingly there was some things i couldnt get done in time / didnt understand

- fix my tests (test was planned and impliemented but didnt get fixed)

- figure out whats wrong with all auth packages, then:

import allauth templates , include base.html and add css styling

its says it doesnt exist even after reinstalling it

# Diagrams, Flowcharts and ERDS

not much planning was done as i had to keep switching and overcoming problems so i had to use what i learned
and created the project 

however there is an ERD for the bookings model which is here:

# agile tools (user stories)

as i was planning this had a notepad and a checklist to go through what ive done and using these to convert into user stories which helped me alot figure out what was done, needs to be done, or has been done.

# Important

## why is the project like this?

overall this resubmission was trying to cover as much criteria as possible using what ive done from my previous project and plannning around that , it has much more into it than before but honestly lacks slighly less than whats needed and what i wanted.

overall i hope my documentation isnt too hard to read. 

it was exasperating but im still learning/relearning  an awful lot from this project

thank you for viewing this project.

## another thing 

some commits may be big due to either importing templates from old projects or dealing with an issue

when making the second app 'mystuff' for the profile stuff it went horribly and i moved all of my work into one commit once it all worked for more a less a clean commit rather than alot of smaller commits that could confuse the user, other the 2 big commits everything should be fine , appologies!
